# Dashboard Overview

## Overview

The UltraThink Dashboard is a local-first observability and control center built with Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4. It runs on `localhost:3333` and provides real-time visibility into the skill mesh, memory, plans, hooks, and system health.

The dashboard is **not decorative**. It is an operational control plane where you can inspect skill connections, browse memory, manage tasks, review hook events, and configure the system.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Version |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) | 15.1+ |
| UI Library | React | 19.0+ |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | v4 |
| Charts | Recharts | 2.15+ |
| Icons | Lucide React | 0.469+ |
| Database | @neondatabase/serverless | 0.10+ |
| Language | TypeScript | 5.7+ |

## Design System

The dashboard uses a dark control-center theme:

- **Background**: Dark slate (`--color-bg`)
- **Text**: Light gray on dark (`--color-text`)
- **Accent**: Warm amber/orange for interactive elements and highlights
- **Health indicators**: Green (healthy), amber (warning), red (critical)
- **Cards**: Bordered with subtle shadow, low-glow effects
- **Typography**: System font stack, antialiased rendering

The layout follows a standard dashboard pattern:
- **Left sidebar** (256px / `pl-64`): Navigation links to all pages
- **Top header**: Breadcrumb, project name, quick actions
- **Main content area**: Page-specific content with 2rem padding

## API Routes

All API routes are in `dashboard/app/api/`:

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/health` | GET | System health check |
| `/api/analytics` | GET | Usage statistics and trends |
| `/api/skills` | GET | Skill registry and metadata |
| `/api/plans` | GET, POST | Plan CRUD operations |
| `/api/kanban` | GET, POST, PATCH | Task management |
| `/api/memory` | GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE | Memory CRUD and search |
| `/api/hooks` | GET | Hook event log and statistics |

## Running the Dashboard

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dashboard:dev
# Or directly:
cd dashboard && npm run dev
```

Starts on `http://localhost:3333` with hot reload.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run dashboard:build
cd dashboard && npm run start
```

### Using the Script

```bash
./scripts/dashboard.sh
```

## Environment Requirements

The dashboard requires `DATABASE_URL` to be set for database-backed features (memory, plans, hooks, analytics). Without it, the dashboard still loads but shows empty states for data-dependent pages.

```bash
# In .env at project root
DATABASE_URL="postgres://<db_user>:<db_password>@<db_host>/<db_name>?sslmode=require"
```
